# Dashboard for UptimeMatrix

UptimeMatrix Dashboard that you can manage services, the replacement for the closed-source version previously hosted on [app.uptimematrix.com](https://app.uptimematrix.com) 

> [!NOTE]
> This uses quite a bit of the code from the original website which may include some generated code. There are most likely unused classes and functions as this is basically a fork of the old closed-source dashboard. Feel free to remove them. This dashboard is still in development and you may see bugs.


> [!WARNING]
> This uses unencrypted passwords for authentication, do not re-use passwords. We recommend protecting the dashboard behind a more secure authentication solution
